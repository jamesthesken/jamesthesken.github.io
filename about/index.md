Welcome! Hope you check out the rest of the site for projects and some other things I'm interested in. I grew up on Kauai and surfed everyday for the most part.

## Some of the topics you'll find on this site:
* Autonomous robotic gardening systems
* Computer vision and machine learning
* How I spent 2 summers flying a drone for America's largest coffee farm
* Rapid prototyping


I started mechanical engineering at the University of Hawaii with professional development goals in mind:

1. Be the well-rounded engineer I met during my first internship at the Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory. 
2. Bridge the gap between mechanical design and software to control it by learning all I could about programming and small electronics.
3. Work on skills that are irreplaceable for the next technological revolution.

Since I started school in 2014 I've worked on developing skills in:
* Python
* Javascript
* C++
* Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.
* Solidworks
* 3D printing
* HTML & CSS
* FPGA development 

Ask anyone that knows me and they'll tell you I am constantly evolving.

Looking for ways to improve myself, while bolstering the relationships with those around me.

Humans are great at adapting.
